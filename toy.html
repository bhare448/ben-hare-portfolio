      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This project was assigned in my "How to Make Stuff" class where the goal was to create a prototype for a children's toy that teaches little kids life skills. I created a child-proof trash can that looked like a character to teach kids how to clean up after themselves. The purpose of this assignment was to teach us to consider the context of use when designing products for different audiences.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="process-section">
      <div class="text-block">
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Ideation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Coming up with an idea for this project proved to be difficult due to the fact that there were already a great number of children's toys in existence that perform similar functions to any idea I came up with. It was also difficult to determine what a young child would find engaging enough to want to use it frequently.
          </li>
          <li>
            After considering the different behaviors that parents want to teach their children, I figured that teaching kids to clean up after themselves would be an important lesson for kids to learn and would also be beneficial to parents.
          </li>
          <li>
            To keep kids engaged, I came up with the idea of turning the trash can itself into a character with a see-through body where kids could see all of the trash they pick up. Instead of viewing the action of cleaning up as a chore, they will instead view it as a way to feed a friend, which will encourage desireable behaviors to be repeated.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Research:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When conducting research on existing kids toys, I noticed that many of them follow a similar design philosophy of turning objects into characters, but not many are effective at teaching important life lessons. I wanted to make this a priority when designing my toy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Brainstorming:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I initially had difficulty considering what kind of shape I wanted to make the trash can and how big to make the mouth so that it will fit a variety of items, but will not be off-putting for children.
          </li>
          <li>
            I eventually decided on a bean shape with a flat bottom so that it will be able to stand upright, but kids will still be able to knock it around without hurting themselves or the toy. The toy will have a detachable upper half so that parents can easily empty the contents of the trash can when it becomes too full.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Prototype:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            With the idea in mind, I began making prototypes in Fusion 360. Creating 3D models was still relatively new to me at the time, so figuring out how to make two separate parts combine into the same shape proved to be difficult, but I eventually accomplished the task and created a model I was happy with.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, I imported the 3D model into Prusa Slicer where it would convert the model into 3D-printable code. The combined total for creating both halves took approximately 6 hours and I wanted to make sure that both halves were detailed enough and came out exactly how I wanted them to.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
      <p>The final product turned out how I expected it to with very few problems along the way. This project was a fun exercise and certainly caused me to more carefully consider audiences and contexts when creating designs. Overall, I am happy to have experienced this process firsthand and I am satisfied with how it turned out.</p>
