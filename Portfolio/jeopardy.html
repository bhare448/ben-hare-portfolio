      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This group project was made for my "Programming for Digital Media" class. We were tasked to create an interactive game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My group decided on a quiz game based on Jeopardy with a Disney theme. Our main priorities when creating the game was ease-of-use and engaging gameplay that created flow. This project taught me how to effectively work in teams when developing a game.</p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Ideation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            One of the options that our professor gave us was to create a quiz-based game. My team decided fairly quickly on this concept because we figured that it sounded the most fun, but would still provide a challenge.
          </li>
          <li>
            We wanted the theme of our quiz show to be something that is diverse, but could still be recognized by everybody. We eventually decided on a Disney theme because it spans across a variety of different series and studios, such as Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Research:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When deciding on what questions to include, I looked at other Disney themed quizzes on the internet to find a good balance that would give casual fans a chance, but provide a decent challenge for hardcore fans.
          </li>
          <li>
            There were not many references for this project, but I looked at other web-based jeopardy games and noted what they did right and how we could incorporate it into our game.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Brainstorming:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My team organized itself into different roles for the project, where I was assigned as the lead programmer. My job was to ensure that the HTML and layout of the website looked presentable, as well as ensuring that any mechanics we were implementing into the game functioned properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            We started a Google Doc and quickly brainstormed what kinds of categories and questions we wanted to include in the game. Once we decided on the categories, each of us chose one and came up with questions. We wanted our game to include a point system displayed at the bottom, animations for right and wrong answers, and a ranking at the end based on how well the user did.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Prototype:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When beginning the creation process of the game, each team member was performing well in their respective roles. Whenever one of us would reach a significant milestone, we would send each other the code and let the other members know what was working and if there needed to be any future changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            One problem that we ran into during development was programming the boxes in a way that would only allow them to be clicked once. After a few days of brainstorming and trial and error, we were able to figure it out and continue development of the game.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
      <p>The finished project was fully functional from start state to end state and the whole team was satisfied with the final product. This project was a challenge for all of us, but by working together and complimenting each other's strengths and weaknesses, we were able to overcome any problems we came across and create a fun game that can be enjoyed by others.</p>
