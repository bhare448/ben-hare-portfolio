      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This app was created for my senior capstone project. The original purpose of the app was to teach people about the environmental benefits of compost and build a community. By the end of the class, my group shifted focus to make it an educational app that uses gamification and bite-sized lessons to teach users how to compost.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="process-section">
      <div class="text-block">
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Ideation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My group began our brainstorming by listing as many problems we could think of and write them on post-it notes. After narrowing it down, we all agreed that composting may be a good concept to base our project around, since even though it has significant environmental benefits, not many people know how to do it or even know what it is.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Research:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Most of our research came from questionnaires and usability tests that we conducted using basic wireframes and prototypes to not only determine if our project is desireable, but what kinds of things users may want in an app like this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our test results suggested that there was a market for our app. Most of our test participants were pleased with the wireframes and claimed they would use the app themselves.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Brainstorming:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Though our test participants were mostly pleased with our app, there was some confusion over some of the gamification mechanics and some were unsure if the community features, such as posts and likes, may not be necessary. Going forward, we were going to have to take these critics into consideration and brainstorm how to make our app more effective.
          </li>
          <li>
            After a few more prototypes and some suggestions from our professor, we decided that we were going to get rid of the community features and focus entirely on the educational aspect of the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            We decided that we were going to have to figure out some kind of system for the gamification mechanics now that we were going this new route. We always wanted to have some kind of point system to reward our users for going through the lessons, but did not know how to implement it. Eventually, we decided on having a digital tree that users would be able to grow using the points that they have earned.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Prototype:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When creating the final, functional prototype, I was put in charge of making the whole wireframe interactive and implementing the screens for the tree-growing gamification mechanics.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
      <p>This project taught me a lot about project management and working in teams. While it was very difficult at times, it provided us with a lot of experience and showed us what it would be like in the work force. In the end, we made something we were all proud of.</p>
